### Challenge

Update the MINDBODY business app’s mobile checkout experience so customers can:

- Learn how to connect the new mobile point-of-sale device, the BBPOS Chipper, along with a tutorial on how to use it
- Let clients review their cart before paying
- Request tips more discreetly

Use a shared UI so developers could build the experience faster.

**Work environment challenge**

In the middle of the design process, management swapped visual designers and the UX designer left the company.

### Solution

Simplify the current experience by combining and eliminating a screens while using consistent elements across Android and iOS apps.

### How I helped

- Guerrilla testing
- Message development and content strategy (specifically around tipping)
- Information architecture

### Team

- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/laura-ziegler/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Laura Ziegler</a>, Product Designer
- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilia-tietje-9081b157/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Emma Tietje</a>, Researcher

### Process

First, I ran a research session to see if the current experience (and the first version of the redesign) was going in the right direction. I also analyzed the competition (Square, Toast).

Laura and I worked closely with the developers since there were legacy technical hurdles with the shared components and the original design. _What code was changeable? Which screens need an error state or microcopy? How can we make this experience simpler? What has to stay because of legal requirements?_

The customer’s cart had to be reviewable before payment request, which required moving the tip request workflow.

### Recommendations

- Simplify content
- Use consistent terms
- Defer to platform styles
- Reorder screens
- Condense button copy to one-word CTAs
- Reduce the number of times the device is being handed between a staff member and customer

### Outcome

Total sales transactions have increased by 7% since the new tipping workflow was released (November 2019).

As of January 2020, the app is processing an average of \$692,000 each month through the mobile checkout experience.
