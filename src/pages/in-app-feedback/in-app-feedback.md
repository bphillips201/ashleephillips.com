### Challenge

Encourage customers to share honest, actionable feedback about their app experience

### Solution

Create an in-app feedback modal that is easy (and delightful) to use and send the info gathered to a Slack channel

### How I helped

- Content strategy and plain language writing
- Message development
- Information architecture
- Taxonomy and grouping

### Team

- Kit French, visual designer
- Kat Cordio, UX designer
- Emma Tietje, researcher

### Process

After researching other apps feedback features, Kit and I worked through several design iterations. Emma, the researcher, and I decided which questions we wanted and how to best phrase them (so we weren’t leading the customers).

### Recommendations

- Keep it short and simple—don’t ask more than two questions
- Don’t make the long-form field required
- Include a photo of the researcher, so customers feel like their feedback is getting read by a human

### Outcome

**So many responses**

The feedback modal has been one of the most popular additions to our app. We received over 400 replies within the first few weeks of release without marketing the survey's existence.
