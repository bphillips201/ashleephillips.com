### Challenge

Take nearly two decades of code, content, and designs that weren’t created with accessibility in mind, and create a process that would lead to AA compliance based on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

But the WCAG is 80+ rules of jargon and difficult-to-understand rules.

### Solution

Make it easy.

Instead of putting the work and accessibility responsibility solely on devs and QA, we decided to let each craft do their part to build accessible products.

### How I helped

- Rewrote the WCAG rules
- Grouped the relevant ones per discipline

### Team

- Tyler Ramsey, Visual Designer
- Alice Hahn, UX Designer
- Danielle Pacheco, UX Designer
- Brian Phillips, Front End Engineering Manager
- Sara Deenanauth, Software Engineering Manager
- Adilene Constante, Front End Engineer
- Rochelle Turner, QA Manager
- Nicole Ely, QA Engineer

### Process

I went through all 80 rules, pulled out the ones that were AA specific, and gave them to each discipline rep.

They rewrote the rules in their craft’s “language,” and I went through the final lists and copyedited them (and I was the copy rep).

From there, we had checklists for each discipline (design, content, dev, and QA) to follow.

### Recommendations

- Group and condense the rules
- Rewrite the rules and make them clearer

### Outcome

Increased accessibility awareness across the org and an easier way to build more accessible products
