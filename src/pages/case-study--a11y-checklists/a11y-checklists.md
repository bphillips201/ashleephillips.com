### Challenge

Take nearly two decades of code, content, and designs that weren’t created with accessibility in mind, and create a process that would lead to AA accessibility compliance based on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

The WCAG is 80+ rules of jargon and difficult-to-understand rules.

### Solution

Make it easy.

Instead of putting the accessibility work solely on developers, we decided to empower each role in Product Development do their part to build accessible products.

### How I helped

- Rewrote the WCAG rules into plain language checklist items
- Grouped the items into discipline-specific sections: Dev, QA, Visual Design, UX Design, and Copy

### Team

- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tylercramsey/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tyler Ramsey</a>, Visual Designer
- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rochellet/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Rochelle Turner</a>, QA Manager
- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicoleely/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nicole Ely</a>, QA Engineer
- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alicemhahn/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Alice Hahn</a>, UX Designer

- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarajeancodes/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sara Deenanauth</a>, Software Engineering Manager
- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adileneconstante/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Adilene Constante</a>, Front End Engineer
- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bphillips201/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Brian Phillips</a>, Front End Engineering Manager

### Process

The team went through all 80 WCAG rules and placed them into a spreadsheet.

Each discipline rewrote the rules in their craft’s "language," then I went through the final lists and copyedited them.

### Recommendations

- Group and condense the rules
- Rewrite the rules and make them clearer

### Outcome

Increased accessibility awareness across the organization and lowered the barrier of entry for building accessible products
