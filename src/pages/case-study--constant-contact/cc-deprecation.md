### Challenge

Migrate existing customers using Constant Contact's integration—and onboard new customers—onto MINDBODY’s similar email campaign feature.

### Solution

Inform customers in phases that Constant Contact’s integration is being removed with an email, modal, and alert banners.

### How I helped

- Message development
- Collaboration between team members in other departments (support and product marketing)

### Team

- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexis-elan-ross/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Alexis Ross</a>, Visual Designer
- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/heysaralancaster/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sara Lancaster</a>, UX Designer
- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marianneconner/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Marianne Connor</a>, Researcher
- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rmdougal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ryan Dougal</a>, Product Marketing Manager

### Process

There were two groups of customers: those using Constant Contact and those not using any type of email marketing. I worked with product marketing to tailor the messaging that would help both groups feel supported in the choice they had to make, whether to keep using Constant Contact (just not with our integration) or start using MINDBODY’s similar tools.

### Recommendations

- Collaborate with product marketing to align on message value props
- Create a sense of urgency (so customers would take action) without getting in their way. They still needed to run their business and were already familiar with the Constant Contact functionality. We needed to explain the situation and the choice they needed to make all while giving them plenty of time to make that educated decision.

### Outcome

**Helpful messaging that informed users about their options without pushing them to upgrade for the sake of it. No dark patterns here.**

We decided on an initial email, an FTU modal, and two alert banners (one on their dashboard and the second in their reports).

### Modal

### Banners

The first alert lets users know when their features would be unavailable.

The second alert was the last chance for users to make a decision.
