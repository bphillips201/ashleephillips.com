### Challenge

Help people understand where to focus their marketing efforts and which tools to set up so they can reach their goals.

### Solution

Develop a streamlined, relevant version of the marketing lifecycle based on MINDBODY’s customers’ needs.

### How I helped

- Content strategy and plain language writing
- Message development
- Information architecture

### Team

- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexis-elan-ross/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Alexis Ross</a>, Visual Designer
- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/heysaralancaster/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sara Lancaster</a>, UX Designer
- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marianneconner/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Marianne Connor</a>, Researcher
- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rmdougal" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ryan Dougal</a>, Product Marketing Manager

### Process

Battling a case of _too many to choose from_, I worked with Product Marketing, Visual and UX Design to help people understand which tools are available, which they need to set up, and which they can use if they upgrade. I worked with Alex to determine where the messaging should live and with Sara to decide how users should interact with it.

### Recommendations

Find a balance between using precise language and deep explanations.

For example, I recommended things like:

- Use little to no marketing language (we didn’t need to pitch to the user)
- Use less MINDBODY jargon
- Don’t interrupt their flow with a modal

### Outcome

**More educational content to guide people through getting and keeping customers.**

Once we agreed on the language choices, we were able to implement them throughout the rest of the page.
