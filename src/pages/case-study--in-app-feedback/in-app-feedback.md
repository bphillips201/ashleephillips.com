### Challenge

Encourage customers to share honest, actionable feedback about their app experience.

### Solution

Create an in-app feedback survey (presented as a modal) that's easy to use. Then, build a repository of the info gathered to use as research for future projects.

### How I helped

- Content strategy and plain language writing
- Message development
- Information architecture
- Taxonomy and grouping

### Team

- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kitfrench/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kit French</a>, Visual Designer
- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katcordio/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kathryn Cordio</a>, UX Designer
- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilia-tietje-9081b157/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Emma Tietje</a>, Researcher

### Process

After researching other apps' feedback features, Kit and I worked through several design iterations. Emma and I decided which questions to ask and how to best phrase them so we weren’t leading the customers.

### Recommendations

- Keep it short and simple—don’t ask more than two questions
- Don’t make the long form field _required_
- Include a photo of the researcher so customers know their responses are getting read by a human

### Outcome

**So many responses**

The feedback modal is one of the most popular additions to our app! We received over 400 replies within the first weeks of release without marketing the survey's existence.
